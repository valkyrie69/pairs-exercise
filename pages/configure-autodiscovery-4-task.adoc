= Configuring the API Autodiscovery in a Mule 4 Application
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

To configure API Autodiscovery in your Mule 4.x application, you must meet the following requirements: //Check order and verify title matches subsequent
. Publish or Import Your API to API Manager
. Enable API Manager to use your Mule Application as the API Proxy
. Configuring Anypoint Platform Organization Credentials in Mule Runtime
. Configuring the Autodiscovery Element in Your Mule Application

== Publish or Import Your API to API Manager

To use your API in API Manager, you must first pair your Mule application with the API Manager. +

* Publish your API in Exchange and import it to API Manager. +
See xref:manage-exchange-api-task.adoc[Manage an API from Exchange].
* Import your API Instance directly from your machine. +
See xref:import-api-task.adoc[To Import an API Instance]. 

== Enable API Manager to use your Mule Application as the API Proxy

To enable API Manager to use your deployed Mule application as the API proxy, complete the following steps: //Required step

//First few steps seem missing - access points, UI directives, page name, user orientation/direction 
. In the *Managing Type* drop-down list, select *Basic Endpoint*.
. In the *Implementation URI* text box, enter the Implementation URI that points to the deployed Mule application.
. Next to the *Check this box if you are managing this API in Mule 4 or above*, select the checkbox.

== Configuring Anypoint Platform Organization Credentials in Mule Runtime

To use Autodiscovery in a Mule Application, the Runtime must start with Anypoint Platform credentials already configured. +
Learn how to configure your organization credentials based on your deployment target in xref:org-credentials-config-mule4.adoc[Configuring Organization Credentials in Mule Runtime 4].

== Configuring the Autodiscovery Element in Your Mule Application

Within the code of your Mule Application, you must configure the `api-gateway:Autodiscovery` element. +
The Autodiscovery element points to the specific API in API Manager to which you want to pair.

[TIP]
If you configured a proxy endpoint for your API, your autogenerated proxy will already be correctly configured with the Autodiscovery element.

.XML element
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<api-gateway:autodiscovery
  apiId="${apiId" // <1>
  flowRef= myFlow /> // <2>
----

<1> Configure the `apiId` with the API ID that API Manager assigned to your API.
<2> Set the `flowRef` element to point to the flow that you want to pair to the API in API Manager.

You can either replace `${apiId}` with your specific value, or you can create a `config.properties` file where you define it in a key-value fashion: `apiId=[your-specific-value]` and reference it as `${apiId}` in this configuration.

You can also configure this using Anypoint Studio's UI:

. In your existing flow, select the Global Elements tab in your Mule Configuration File editor.
. Click the Create button, and look for the API Autodiscovery global element.

. Set the API ID and Flow Reference. +
+
image::auto-discovery-api-config.png[align=center]
+
You can also choose to use the `${apiId}` value and reference it from a `config.properties` file.

After the element is defined in the application, and the runtime is configured  with your Anypoint Platform credentials, Mule Runtime will automatically track and keep up to date with the API configuration. defined in API Manager.
//_COMBAK: Does this need to be deployed for the green dot to show in API Manager?

== Changes from Mule 3.x Configuration

API Autodiscovery element has syntactically changed from Mule 3.x but its purpose remains the same. The element in a Mule Application has the following format:

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a"]
|===
^| Mule 3.x XML element ^| Mule 4.x XML element
^| <api-platform-gw:api (...)/>. ^| <api-gateway:autodiscovery (...)/>.
|===

In Mule 4, the API is identified by the API Id and a reference to a Flow where the HTTP listener is defined. Mule 4â€™s apiId replaces the apiName and apiVersion used to specify the Autodiscovery element in Mule 3.x and prior.
