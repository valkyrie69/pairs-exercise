= Anypoint Connector Tutorial

After learning some of the basic functionality in the Basic Studio Tutorial and in the How to Create a Mule App Tutorial, it is time to enriching your application with an *Anypoint Connector*.

[NOTE]
Anypoint Studio comes with a set of connectors that can be easily added to your Studio flow. You may find all certified connectors in xref:exchange::index.adoc[Anypoint Exchange].

== What is an Anypoint Connector?

Anypoint Connectors are extensions that will allow you to operate in external systems such as Salesforce, Google Contacts, ServiceNow, Workday, Facebook, Twitter, or MongoDB to integrate information from these systems to create something new. Connectors simplify the interaction with the SaaS providers' APIs, providing methods for most of all the available operations.

== How to Configure

Typically, you will be performing these steps to configure a connector:

. Store the authentication, connection, or other settings in a *Properties file*. 
. Reference the properties from the *connector configuration*. The connector configuration is automatically stored by Studio as a global element that can be used by any other connector instance using the same properties.
. Test the connection from the configuration dialog.

[TIP]
Properties files can be used to provide a convenient mechanism for storing variables in a central location.

The main functionality of connectors dependents on its target, so there are many features most connectors may have in common. After creating and running the applications in this tutorial, you should be able to apply what you have learned to connect applications to various SaaS applications.

== Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have Anypoint Studio. If you do not have any previous experience with Eclipse or an Eclipse-based IDE, you can review the brief introduction to the Anypoint Studio interface, and the document describing Global Elements in Mule. Furthermore, you can consider following the xref:6@studio::basic-studio-tutorial.adoc[Basic] and xref:content-based-routing.adoc[Content-Based Routing] tutorials.

NOTE: You have to obtain Twitter developer access to a Twitter app that you create in order to complete this tutorial. See <<Obtaining Access to the Twitter API>> to learn how to get a Twitter developer access and create a simple app.

== Goals for this Tutorial

In this tutorial, your goals are:

. Walk through the process for obtaining Twitter API access and credentials.
. Creating an application in Anypoint studio that uses a connector to access the Twitter API.
. Learning how to use Global Elements and Foreach scope in the application.
. Run the application on a local runtime, which is embedded in Anypoint Studio.
. Test the application using a browser.
. Stop the app.
. _(Optional)_ Apply your knowledge to an extra credit challenge.

== Obtaining Access to the Twitter API

In order to use the Twitter API you must first create a Twitter developer account for which to obtain a set of credentials.

. If you don't already have one, create a https://twitter.com/signup[regular Twitter account]. You may wish to create an account specifically for testing for posting various different things to Twitter in this exercise. Twitter prompts you to create a standard Twitter account. Supply you're full name, email address, a password, and user name. Go through the prompts to complete the process. Twitter will send you an email, which is a confirmation or a text message if you supplied a phone number. Visit the https://dev.twitter.com/[Twitter dev.twitter.com Developer's page] and sing in using your Twitter account credentials. 
. This activity creates a separate developer account for you, with an association to your regular Twitter account.
. To create a new *Twitter Application*, navigate to https://apps.twitter.com/[https://apps.twitter.com/].
. Complete the *Application Details* form according to the table and image below.

|===
|Field |Value
|*Name* |A name for your application which must be unique to the Twitter system and which cannot contain the word "Twitter".
|*Description* |A brief overview of the application your building.
|*Website* |An entry is required here, however, because this Twitter application is not public, this field is not meaningful; enter a full URL placeholder value. You can simply use a name like `+http://www.example.com+`. Note that partial URLs like `example.com` are not accepted.
|*Callback URL* |Leave blank.

. Agree to the terms and click on the *Create your Twitter application* if you agree.
+
. Click on the *Keys and Access Tokens* tab and scroll down to click *Create my access token*.

[NOTE]
====
Using an access token, you can easily connect with the Twitter API using your application. However, your access to the API is restricted to your user account. For the purposes of this tutorial, an access token gives you the access which you need for your application to interact with the Twitter API.

Later, if you want to expose such an application publicly, you need to configure your application to authenticate via OAuth.
====
+
. Scroll down the page in the browser to display the values for *Access token* and *Access token secret* because you need to enter these values in Anypoint Studio record the following four keys from Twitter (refer to the image below):
.. Consumer Key
.. Consumer Secret
.. Access Token
.. Access Token Secret
